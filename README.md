you need a mashape APi key

https://market.mashape.com/explore?sort=developers

- say a random quote from a famous person or movie
- say a random fact about a number
- say how much time you are have left to live based on gender and birthdate (life expectancy)


issues:

vocab has not been set yet, just keywords for quick testing

- quote
- timetolive
- fact

not loading from config file, must add api birthdate and gender manually in init.py
